# encrypt
Here's a Bash script that can be used to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES encryption algorithm.
This script provides a menu for encrypting and decrypting files using the AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm. It uses openssl to perform the encryption and decryption operations.

Save this script to a file, such as file_name.sh, and make it executable:
chmod +x file_encrypt_decrypt.sh

You can then run the script and follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt files using a user-provided password.
